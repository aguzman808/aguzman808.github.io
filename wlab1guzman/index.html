<h3>Beerus's History</h3>
<p> Lord Beerus otherwise known as the god of destruction of universe 7 napped on screen for the first time in the movie dbz:Battle of the gods. in his first appearance in the series he is seen waking up from a 38 year long "nap" as stated by his attendant Whis. </p>
<p>Once awoken Beerus immediately sought answers to his dream/vison of him finally fighting an opponent that could challenge him in battle, a warrior known as the super saiyan god , he had asked the oracle fish on the propechy of facing the super saiyan god,after finding out where the last remaining saiyans were he traveled to king kai's planet where goku was training.</p>
<p>After talking about being persuaded by goku to fight, Beerus quickly took care of the saiyan and beat with a single flick of his finger.Completing his journey to earth Beerus landed on a yacht where bulmas birthday party was being held, he then proceeded to to crash the party because he couldn't indulge in his first pudding cup because majin buu ate all of them,after crashing the party he then slaps bulma after getting slapped himself and proceeding to squabble with vegeta for like 10 seconds, beerus decides to destroy the earth with the only thing stopping him being goku after performing the a saiyan ritual to become the super saiyan god,Beerus then got his dram come true as for the first time since he could remember he had found a being let alone a mortal who could challenge his power, although that dream was short lived as during their batte goku fell out of his god state not that being in a god state was enough to beat beerus, beerus won the fight but before he destroyed earth he "fell" asleep. beerus now has become a sort of mentor figure and frien to goku and vegeta hoping that vegeta will take his place as th god of destruction someday, on a quick sidenote beerus has stated that the only reason he hasn't destroyed earth is because of the delicious and vast variety of food.</p>

                                     <h3>things beerus is better at than other G.O.D's</h3>

<p>Beerus has been stated multiple times as the strongest god of destruction, as in the manga during the God tournement not the Top, he took on multiple Gods in combat and held his own.
Abilities/techniques: Hakai which grants the user the ability to erase any thing or being, Sphere of destructionm, a massive energy ball can easily destroy whatever is in it's path
god of destructions wrath, beerus spreads out his body to realease a flurry of energy balls in all directions, ultra instict (omen),althought beerus has only entered UI once he is the only god to do so which not only puts him a clear cut above the rest but gives the abilites of ultra instinct and allows him to fight without thinking or wasting his movements.</p>
